                        <h5>You may not force others to lose the game</h5>
                        <p>If someone plays a version of LDB for an in-person audience for the express purpose of ruining someone's game, the player has not lost the game. </p>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Mass-Media Broadcasts are fair game</h5>
                        <p>Playing the LDB song via a mass-audience medium (e.g. a radio station) is considered fair game.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Anyone has power to call you out</h5>
                        <p>If a player is exposed to the LDB song, but has not (yet) recognized it, anyone may call the player's attention to the song while it is playing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5> You may listen to the song if new 1 time and 1 time only</h5>
                        <p>If you are new to the LDB game, you may purposely listen to the song here one time and one time only.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h5> Don't be a sore loser</h5>
                        <p>It is considered 'Good Form' to announce any losses to fellow players. (This especially applies to non-binding losses during the 'Pre-Season'.) </p>

                <h3>'Tis The Season'</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>The Game begins on the fourth Thursday of November. In the U.S., this is known as Thanksgiving. If you are not celebrating Thanksgiving with a meal on this day, then your game starts at 12:01AM. If you are having a Thanksgiving meal on this day, then your game starts as soon as you finish your Thanksgiving meal. </p>
                <p>The ‘Regular Season’ lasts until 12:01AM on December 26th. If a player hasn’t been knocked out during the ‘Regular Season’, they may opt to continue playing in the ‘Bonus Round’ which lasts until 12:01AM on January 1st. Before the 2011 season, this was the stated ending rule: “The game is played until midnight on New Year’s Eve. If you have not heard the LDB song by that time, you win!”</p>

            <h3>How this started</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>After publishing this site for the 2010 Holiday Season, I was contacted by several people who claimed to have created the LDB Game around 2000-2001, and wrote down the rules for their Facebook Group in 2009.</p>
            <p>A few of their suggestions have been incorporated for the 2011 and later seasons, but keep in mind that other LDB players may be playing from a different ruleset. </p>
